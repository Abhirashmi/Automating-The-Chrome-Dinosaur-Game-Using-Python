# Automating-The-Chrome-Dinosaur-Game-Using-Python
we all have faced network issues while suffering on the google chrome browser . and while the network is interrupted we all have played the DINASOUR GAME
so in this program i wil  be automating the dinasore and the game is played by the computer itself . s
so the challanges we have
1. making our dinasour jump
## AS we can see the cactus along with the path is coming towards the dinasaur . not the dinasaur is running
2. detecting the cactus coming 
so we can detect birds and cactus using pixels of different colors
